# Application Layer
* The application layer orchestrates use cases by coordinating domain objects and infrastructure services.




### Reasons for this structure:

1. Application Layer Responsibility:
* CaseService in the application layer orchestrates the use case of creating a case, which involves multiple steps and potentially multiple domain objects.


2. Domain Layer Purity:

* Keeping CaseService in the application layer helps maintain the domain layer's focus on core business rules and entities.


3. Dependency Inversion:

* The application service depends on repository interfaces defined in the domain layer, adhering to the Dependency Inversion Principle.


4. Use Case Centralization:

* Having CaseService in the application layer centralizes use case logic, making it easier to manage and modify business processes.


5. Testability:

* This structure allows for easier unit testing of the application service by mocking the repositories.



This approach aligns well with clean architecture principles, where:

The domain layer contains core business logic and interfaces.
The application layer contains use case implementations and orchestration.
The infrastructure layer contains implementations of interfaces defined in the domain layer.
